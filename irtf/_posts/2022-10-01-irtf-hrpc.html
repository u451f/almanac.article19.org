    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>HRPC explores the relationship between internet protocols and human
        rights. It proposes guidelines to inform future protocol development
        and aims to increase awareness of the importance of the technical
        workings of the internet to the expression of human rights. It also
        aims to prepare participants to raise human rights concerns directly in
        IETF working groups.
