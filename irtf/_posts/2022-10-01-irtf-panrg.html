        PANRG aims to research the development of path awareness within the
        transport and application layers, whereby <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/glossary/what-is-endpoint/"
        class="glossary">endpoints</a> can discover the properties of various
        data paths and select data paths for the exchange of data and
        information. Currently, endpoints in IP-based networks have little
        information about the data paths over which their traffic is carried,
        nor do they have control over choosing the data path. Through
        path-aware networking methods, endpoints can potentially select data
        paths that are more trusted and less vulnerable to snooping and
        monitoring from malicious actors, protecting privacy and security.
