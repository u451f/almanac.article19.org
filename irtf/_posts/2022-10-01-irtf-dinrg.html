    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>DINRG aims to research use cases, requirements, and best practices
         to decentralise core internet infrastructure and related protocols,
         such as the <a href="https://www.icann.org/rdap">Registration Data
         Access Protocol (RDAP)</a>. RDAP allows users to access the current
        website registration data in a secure manner by encrypting the data
        between the server and client. Internet registrars are mandated by the
        Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to implement
        RDAP. With internet infrastructure services – such as web hosting
        providers and content delivery networks – becoming more centralised among
        a smaller number of companies, the entire network becomes dependent on a
        single point of failure, creating the risk that if a single provider is
        compromised, a large number of websites will go offline simultaneously and
        limit peoples’ ability to access or disseminate information. Decentralised
        networks can bypass censorship, as peers interact directly rather than
        through centralised infrastructure providers that control information
        flows.</p>
