This is a visual map for those who are curious about which actors dominate the standardisation of internet infrastructure. It contains an overview to see which actors hold the most power in setting standards across internet-related standards developing organisations and how dominance has changed over the years. Feel free to click on actors in order to isolate or monitor their activity over time! <a href="{{ site.url }}/guess-who-howto.html">How do I use these graphs?</a>
