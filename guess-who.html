    <h2 class="title">Guess who! - Who are the most dominant actors in setting standards?</h2>
    <p>This is a visual map for those who are curious about which actors are dominating the standardisation of internet infrastructure. This map aims to answer three questions:</p>
    <ul class="bubble-list">
        <li class="bubble">Which actors are most dominant in formal leadership positions of groups and committees within the Internet Standards Almanac?</li>
        <li class="bubble">Which actors are most dominant in authoring published technical standards in groups and committees identified in the Internet Standards Almanac?</li>
        <li class="bubble">Which actors are most dominant in discussions in groups and committees identified in the Internet Standards Almanac?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This map aims to help you visualise the dominance of particular actors across internet-related SDOs with an overview of each SDO as well as a granular level within particular groups and committees. Feel free to toggle around to see how dominance has changed over the years.</p>
    <p class="screen-reader">The raw data used to generate these visualisations may be accessed <a href="https://github.com/u451f/almanac.article19.org/tree/devel/assets/data/overview">here</a>.</p>
