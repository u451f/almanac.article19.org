        <ul class="bubble-list">
            <li class="bubble"><b>Who leads?</b> Which actors dominate formal leadership positions of groups and committees within the Internet Standards Almanac?</li>
            <li class="bubble"><b>Who speaks?</b> Which actors dominate discussions in groups and committees identified in the Internet Standards Almanac?</li>
            <li class="bubble"><b>Who publishes?</b> Which actors publish the most technical standards in groups and committees identified in the Internet Standards Almanac?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This map aims to help you see which actors hold the most power in setting standards  across internet-related standards developing organisations (SDOs). It contains an overview of each SDO as well as a granular list of working groups and committees within that SDO. Feel free to toggle around to see how dominance has changed over the years. <a href="{{ site.url }}/guess-who-howto.html">How to use the dashboard?</a></p>
            <p class="screen-reader-text">The following data visualisations depict 1. the chairing periods of the 10 most active actors  2. the amount of emails sent by the 10 most active actors, 3. the amount of published standards related to the 10 most active actors in an SDO. The raw data is available <a href="https://github.com/u451f/almanac.article19.org/tree/master/assets/data/overview/">here</a>.</p>
