    Text and analysis ©ARTICLE 19, 2023-2025</p>

    <p>
    <b>ARTICLE 19</b> works for a world where all people everywhere can freely express
    themselves and actively engage in public life without fear of
    discrimination. We do this by working on two interlocking freedoms, which
    set the foundation for all our work. The Freedom to Speak concerns
    everyone’s right to express and disseminate opinions, ideas and information
    through any means, as well as to disagree from, and question power-holders.
    The Freedom to Know concerns the right to demand and receive information by
    power-holders for transparency, good governance, and sustainable
    development.  When either of these freedoms comes under threat, by the
    failure of power-holders to adequately protect them, ARTICLE 19 speaks with
    one voice, through courts of law, through global and regional
    organisations, and through civil society wherever we are present.
