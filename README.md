### Adding new data to the dashboard

- Add CSV files to *assets/data/dashboard/* either to the *authorship*,
  *leadership* or *influence* folder. The file should be named after
  this scheme: *$sdo_$wg*, e.g. *ietf_add.csv*

### JS libraries

We use the Plotly Javascript library. It's quite heavy per se, but
custom bundles can be created. [Documentation](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md)

This was done:

```
mkdir bundle
npm i plotly.js
cd node_modules/plotly.js
npm i
npm run custom-bundle -- --out almanac-bundle --traces scatter,bar --transforms none
cp dist/plotly-almanac-bundle.min.js ../../assets/js/lib/
```

â†’ then load the new file in _includes/header.html
