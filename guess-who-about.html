        <h2 class="title">1. Who leads? Who chairs working groups and committees within SDOs the longest?</h2>
        <p>People occupying formal positions can shape the agenda, control
        discussions, determine who has the chance to speak, and which proposals
        and contributions are accepted. From ARTICLE 19’s own experience
        engaging in technical standards, we’ve seen chairs have total control
        of when a meeting starts and ends, particularly when conducted
        remotely.</p>

        <h2 class="title">2. Who speaks? Who dominates discussions and how?</h2>
        <p>Various SDOs continue to use mailing
        lists as a primary mode of participation and communication in working
        groups and committees. Participants can actively make contributions and
        object to various proposals. Analysing mailing lists provides further
        information into the extent to which dominant players lead, communicate
        and control the decision-making process.

        <h2 class="title">3. Who publishes? Who authors the most technical standards each year?</h2>
        <p>
        Authorship is one of the most direct ways to engage in standards
        development. Authors have more control over the process as they lead
        and facilitate the proposal through decision-making discussions. As
        technical standardisation is a lengthy process, a draft or a proposal
        made by a participant in an SDO must be reviewed and accepted by its
        technical community. Even if a draft is published, it is subject to
        iterative improvements and deliberations from the community. Publishing
        a draft does not guarantee that it will become a standard. To get a
        draft standard published, participants must successfully dedicate time
        and resources, and persuade the technical community within the
        respective decision-making process. Therefore, for the purpose of this
        research, we focused our analysis on authorship of published standards
        only.

    <h2 class="title">About the data</h2>
        <p>
        For this research, we leveraged various web-scraping tools to analyse which actors dominate technical standard setting. We used BigBang to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of mailing lists.
        </p>
        <p><b>About BigBang</b><br>
        <a href="https://datactive.github.io/bigbang/">BigBang</a> is an
        open source toolkit for data science on communications and
        collaboration data. Launched in 2014, it is primarily used for the
        collection, preprocessing, and analysis of data from SDOs.</p>

        <p>BigBang collects information from public sources and in compliance
        with the privacy policies of SDOs. Often this is through APIs provided by
        the SDOs themselves. BigBang contains useful scripts for data cleaning,
        as well as for the implementation of complex queries, such as those that
        identify authorship, leadership, and influence within working groups.
        The BigBang project retains metadata about organisations, but not about
        individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
        We encourage anybody interested in working with BigBang to check out
        the <a

    <div class="descriptive-txt">
        <h2 class="title">How to use the dashboard?</h2>
        <p>We recommend using the dashboard on a large, hi-res screen.
        Mobile devices and smaller screens will show less detail, diminishing the user experience.
        </p>

        <p>Select the working group or organisation you want to look at. By
        default, you’ll see information about the 'dnsop' working group in the
        IETF. You can then view three different visualisations for authorship,
        influence, and leadership within the selected group or
        organisation.</p>

        <p> Hovering over any of the three visualisation allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zoom in, zoom out, and reset to the initial scale.</li>
            <li>Export plots by clicking on the camera icon. The export will always show the current view (i.e the currently visible selection and current zoom level). The exported file is a scalable vector image with a transparent background.</li>
            <li>You can also view individual actors within each plot by double clicking their name in the legend below / to the right of each plot.</li>
            <li>Further you can toggle other actors on and off by clicking on them.</li>
        </ul>
