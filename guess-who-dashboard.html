<p>The dashboard shows detailed data about the dominant actors in either a specific working group or a broader view from select working groups within a standards developing organisation. If that's a little too detailed, start by <a href="{{ site.url }}/guess-who-overview.html">getting an overview of our findings</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}/guess-who-about.html">learn more about our research and how to use the dashboard</a> first.</p>
<p class="screen-reader">The raw data used to generate these visualisations may be accessed <a href="https://github.com/u451f/almanac.article19.org/tree/devel/assets/data/dashboard">here</a>.</p>
