    <h2 class="title">Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This is a guide for those who are curious about engaging in the
    standardisation of internet infrastructure, but might not be sure about how,
    where, and which issues are up for discussion. This almanac answers two primary
    questions:</p>
    <ul class="bubble-list">
        <li class="bubble">Which standards developing organisations (SDOs) are developing standards that have human rights implications?</li>
        <li class="bubble">How do these standards impact human rights?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here, you’ll find the major internet-related SDOs, and the various
    groups and committees within each of them that are working on relevant
    issues. Using the tags, you can organise your search by topic to identify
    which groups or committees are working on a particular issue or impacting a
    particular right.</p>
    <p><b>Happy exploring!</b></p>
