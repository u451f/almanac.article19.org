        <p>FR aims to define both architectural and technical requirements for
        face recognition systems, specifically those related to function,
        performance, and security. Facial recognition technologies can
        normalise mass surveillance, as they can profile and track individuals
        in public spaces based on facial characteristics without their consent.
        This can be misused to target marginalised communities and stifle
        participation in protests. There are also concerns over racial and
        gender bias where individuals have been wrongfully arrested based on
        erroneous facial recognition matches.  </p>
