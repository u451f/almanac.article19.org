        <p>PAT CG aims to develop web features and APIs that support
        advertising while safeguarding user privacy. Through the use of
        cookies, advertisers and publishers can measure the effectiveness of
        their ads by determining whether a user purchases a product after
        engaging with an ad. This can allow advertisers to track users across
        websites where their ads have been placed.</p>

        <li><b>Standards under development:</b> <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/ipa">Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA)</a> uses anonymous identifiers when tracking ad engagement and related behaviours. This may prevent usersâ€™ browsing behaviour from being directly linked to them while measuring the effectiveness of online ads.</li>
