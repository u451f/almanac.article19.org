        <p>DID WG aims to standardise the architecture for the

        class="glossary">Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</a>
        and recommend specifications and characteristics for
        implementation. Decentralised identifiers are designed to be
        independent of a central registry or identity provider. Rather than
        relying on identity providers (such as Google Sign-in), which have
        control over the information associated with usersâ€™ identity, users
        have control over the information they use to prove who they are to
        online services and applications. However, these systems need to have
        robust cryptographic authentication and secure communication protocols
        to prevent malicious actors from accessing personally identifiable
        information, which can then be used to track and profile individuals.
