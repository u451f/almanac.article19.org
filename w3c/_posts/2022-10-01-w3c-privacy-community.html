        <p>Privacy CG aims to develop web features and APIs that improve user
        privacy through browser enhancements. The design of these features
        impact how cookies and browsing information is stored and shared.
        Security vulnerabilities may allow malicious actors to obtain a user's
        session cookies to impersonate the user, perform actions on behalf of
        the user, or gain access to sensitive information.
