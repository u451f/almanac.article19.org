    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>Web-Adv acts as a forum for stakeholders to identify where online
        advertising can be more effective and secure. Online advertising models
        have often led to increased tracking of user behaviour and browsing
        patterns to identify and profile individuals. The group serves to
        identify and incubate privacy-preserving models of advertising, rather
        than develop standards themselves. While the group does not look at
        technical proposals anymore, it is primarily a place for the discussion
        of topics and gathering of use cases and requirements before proposals
        are developed in community groups and working groups.  </p>
