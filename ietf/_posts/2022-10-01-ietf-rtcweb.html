    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>RTCWEB standardises mechanisms that allow for the transmission of
        real-time audio, video, and collaboration between browsers. WebRTC
        sessions can be used to extract audio or video data from the browser if
        the user doesn’t understand the permissions-granting process. Real-time
        data streams can facilitate linkable, persistent identification of
        otherwise anonymous clients. Conferencing sessions that appear to be
        encrypted to the user may not be fully encrypted end-to-end, allowing
        the site operator to snoop on or record communications between
        unsuspecting parties. These gaps may fundamentally compromise people’s
        privacy and the security of communication channels that people use
        every day.</p>
