    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>PPM aims to develop protocols that collect data and information at
        the application layer for measurement purposes, while also protecting
        an individual’s privacy. Researchers and companies may require
        measurements to determine trends within a large population sample; for
        example, how many websites fail to render or how many applications fail
        to respond. Some of the data reported, such as IP addresses, are
        personally identifiable information and can be used to track or profile
        individuals. New cryptographic techniques where multiple servers
        compute aggregated statistics without learning a set of measurements
        may prevent attackers from connecting the measurements to an
        individual. One of the working group's contentions relates to the
        balance between a proposed protocol's reliance on cryptographic
        mechanisms, interactions of non-colluding parties, and policies of
        individual actors. This leads to questions such as how precise the
        aggregated measurements would be.</p>
