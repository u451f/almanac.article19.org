    <h1 class="title">Adaptive DNS Discovery |&nbsp;ADD</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>ADD works on mechanisms to allow the client to discover resolvers
        and their properties. It defines the mechanisms through which DNS
        resolver information is communicated, allowing the client to decide
        which DNS server to use. Its current focus is to limit data leakage
        that happens during multi-hop DNS resolution between DNS resolvers.
        Sending DNS messages over encrypted transports to DNS resolvers can
        prevent malicious actors from snooping on the contents of DNS messages
        and modifying DNS traffic to block responses from selective queries.
        This can prevent internet service providers or government actors from
        monitoring or blocking users who attempt to access certain
        websites.</p>
