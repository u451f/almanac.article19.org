    <h1 class="title">Privacy Pass</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        <p> Privacy Pass aims to standardise a mechanism that will improve the
        <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/how-captchas-work/"
        class="glossary">CAPTCHA</a> model to increase user privacy. CAPTCHAs
        are used to distinguish between humans and computers to prevent bots
        from sending repeated requests in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
        attacks or engaging in other malicious activities. In the current
        common use case, after completing a CAPTCHA, a cookie is stored on the
        client application to show a server that the client has been verified
        for future purposes. However, this allows for the server to link
        together all the user’s connections that have required authorisation,
        giving the server the ability to monitor a user’s browsing history and
        behaviour and even identify the user. This new mechanism could offer a
        significant opportunity for any site that currently uses CAPTCHA to
        enhance the anonymity available to its user base. For this to be
        implemented, however, web browsers must be willing to accept Privacy
        Pass tokens from a small number of issuers.  </p>
