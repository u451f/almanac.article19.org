    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>MLS aims to develop a standard messaging security protocol for user
        communication, particularly in group chats. Standardising security
        protocols for group chats can increase the security and privacy of
        online communications and prevent malicious actors from tampering or
         eavesdropping on an individual’s messages. While the group’s aim is not
         for interoperable platforms, their work lays the potential for
         interoperability in messaging between platforms.

        <li><b>Standard under development:</b> The <a
         href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">MLS
         protocol</a> was submitted in September 2022 to the Internet
        Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for technical review and approval to
        become an IETF standard. This will be an open standard that can be adopted
        by various communication platforms to increase user security and privacy
        in group chats.
