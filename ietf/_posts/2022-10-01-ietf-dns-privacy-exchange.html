    <h1 class="title">DNS Privacy Exchange |&nbsp;DPRIVE</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>DPRIVE defines the transactions between a recursive resolver and
        authoritative servers. Its current focus is on preventing pervasive
        monitoring during exchanges between DNS servers, in an attempt to limit
        the amount of data leakage that happens during multi-hop DNS
        resolution. A large amount of information, including the domain name,
        request type and response, is shared between servers when making a DNS
        request to a server. Data leakage can lead to monitoring of users or
        blocking of information being requested. Encrypting DNS exchanges can
        prevent possible monitoring, blocking, and filtering of websites.</p>
