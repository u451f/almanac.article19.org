            class="glossary">Path Computation Element (PCE)</a>-based network
            to allow for network nodes to determine and find a suitable data
            path to send information from the source to the destination. By
            having access to topology information of an entire network, the PCE
            can select a routing path that is efficient, improves traffic
            performance, and is adaptive to network changes. By factoring in
            security considerations, the PCE can also potentially select data
            paths that are more secure and less vulnerable to monitoring from
            malicious actors, protecting user privacy and security.  On the
            other hand, the availability of descriptions of path-based
            constraints can facilitate or legitimise overreaching demands for
            information from intermediary network operators.</p>
