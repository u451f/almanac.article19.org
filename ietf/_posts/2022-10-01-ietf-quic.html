        <p>QUIC focuses on the maintenance and evolution of the encrypted
        transport protocol QUIC, supporting its implementation and developing
        possible extensions to it. Created initially by Google and growing in
        usage, QUIC is designed to combine cryptographic protections with
        transport protocols, folding security and transport into the same
        mechanism. Despite this robustness, the deployment model for QUIC is
        structured so that, in the case of failure, systems that prefer to use
        QUIC will revert to TLS-over-TCP. This means that a malicious network
        operator that objects to QUIC – and its ability to hide metadata – can
        simply block it, so clients will default to less secure protocols.
