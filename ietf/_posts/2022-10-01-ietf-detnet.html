    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>DetNet develops routing and signalling protocols for deterministic
        networks under single administrative control. Deterministic networks
        are networks with features designed to provide explicit guarantees
        about message deliverability; as such, these features increase
        reliability and potentially guarantee low latency and zero data loss.
        With technologies and services such as video and audio streaming and
        real-time communications requiring real-time responses, deterministic
        networks aim to establish data flows that improve the quality of
        service and reduce any potential lag in the connection. Most feasible
        deterministic network deployments depend on single or closed-group
        administrative control over the network, so they are not relevant for
        Internet-spanning communications. However, by concentrating control in
        the hands of a single administrator, these networks can potentially
        grant the administrator significant powers of snooping and monitoring,
        and in turn impact usersâ€™ privacy and anonymity.</p>
