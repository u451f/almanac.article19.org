        <p> OHAI aims to define a protocol to <a
            href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/http-requests"
            class="glossary">anonymise HTTP</a> requests using a partly-trusted
        intermediary. HTTP requests can reveal information about the client to
        a server. Over time, servers are able to use this information to
        assemble profiles of the client’s behaviour and make inferences about
        the people that use these clients. One widely-anticipated use of OHAI
        is a way to mask DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) queries, making it difficult for
        anyone to aggregate information about specific DNS requests made from a
        given client. This can provide a degree of protection against servers
        correlating requests and increase user privacy.</p>
