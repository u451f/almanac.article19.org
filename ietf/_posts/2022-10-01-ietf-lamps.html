    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>LAMPS aims to update standards for cryptographic security including
        public key certificates and the protection of emails, particularly <a
        href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/email-headers/"
        class="glossary">email headers</a>. Currently, most email encryption
        applications can encrypt the body and contents of the email, but leave the
        email header vulnerable to attackers who can then redirect users to malicious
        content. Alternatively, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to
        determine the sender’s IP address and the intended receiver. The working
        group's focus on public key certificates has led to a significant amount of
        work on post-quantum cryptography – cryptographic signing and key exchange
        mechanisms that are resistant to attack by quantum computers, a novel (and
        as-yet undemonstrated) computational architecture that is likely to break most
        widely-deployed forms of asymmetric cryptography.</p>
