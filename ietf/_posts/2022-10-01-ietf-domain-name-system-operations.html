        DNSOP discusses current DNS-related issues in technology and
        operations, providing guidelines on how DNS software can be efficiently
        and correctly administered, configured, and operated in the context of
        internet networks. It also publishes documents related to the
        implementation of <a
        href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en"
        class="glossary">DNS Security Extensions</a> (DNSSEC) and
        operationalisation of <a
        href="https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/ipv4-vs-ipv6"
        class="glossary">IPv4 and IPv6</a> networks. Promoting authentication and
        verification mechanisms within DNS operations can enhance the security of the
        DNS, which is vulnerable to attacks that hijack and take control of any step of
        the DNS lookup process. Such attacks can, for example, direct users to a
        malicious website for username and password collection and extract an
        individual’s sensitive information.
