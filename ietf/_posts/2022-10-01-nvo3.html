    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>NVO3 develops protocols that support <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-network-virtualization" class="glossary">network virtualisation</a> and
        operate over an IP underlay transport network within a data centre
        environment. Increasing demand from applications for computation, data
        storage, and network resources requires increased scalability, agility,
        and flexibility for adding, moving, and connecting services. Network
        virtualisation responds to this demand. As such, a virtual network must
        be able to communicate both with other networks. Given the fact that
        many virtual networks are often hosted in one data centre, a high level
        of security and privacy is required to prevent the traffic of one
        network being exposed to another. Data leakage can lead to the exposure
        of personally identifiable information, which can be used to track
        users associated with a particular network.</p>

        <li><b>Standards under development:</b> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-encap/">Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Encapsulation Considerations</a> is an informational document on the considerations made by the NVO3 design team to encapsulate layer 2 traffic in packets to be transported over layer 3. These considerations will address issues such as corruption in the Virtual Network Identifier (VNI), which would lead to leakage of data or attackers attempting to inject packets with spoofed VNIs, leading users to malware.</li>
