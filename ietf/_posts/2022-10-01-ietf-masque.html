    <div class="wg-description">
        <p> MASQUE aims to develop mechanisms for proxied communications,
        whereby a client connecting to an entry server has a directive that
        effectively creates a tunnel to another server. This is often used by
        VPNs to enable users to browse the web without revealing their real IP
        addresses. It can provide countermeasures for people and network
        services operating behind restrictive surveillance or censorship
        regimes in order to access and distribute information that normally
        would be blocked. MASQUE is similar to some aspects of the Tor
        project’s network of nodes, but uses <a

        class="glossary">QUIC</a> to provide anonymisation of network
        traffic. It is also designed for operation by large providers, whereas
        Tor is designed for a large number of small providers. It is also used
        in systems like Apple’s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-apple-private-relay-and-is-it-worse-than-a-vpn"
