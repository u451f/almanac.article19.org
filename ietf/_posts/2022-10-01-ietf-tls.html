        <p>TLS aims to improve the applicability and suitability of the TLS
        family of protocols for use in other emerging protocols and use cases.
        TLS and its relatives are widely relied on to implement cryptography on
        the web and provide secure communication over a network, including in
        the QUIC protocol. This group is currently working to encrypt the
        ClientHello <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"
        class="glossary">Server Name Indication (SNI)</a> , which the client
        uses at the beginning of the TLS handshake to declare what service
        (such as a website) the user is requesting. This declaration is
        necessary for the server to decide which certificate to present. SNI,
        however, makes it possible for censors or filters to block users from
        accessing sensitive websites.</p>

        <li><b>Standard under development:</b> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/">TLS Encrypted Client Hello</a> sets out a mechanism in TLS to encrypt a ClientHello message to potentially prevent malicious actors from reading the SNI and leaking information about which websites a user is trying to access.</li>
