<p>These graphs aim to help you see which actors hold the most power in setting
standards across internet-related standards developing organisations (SDOs)
over time. They contain a granular list of working groups and committees within
selected SDOs. Feel free to toggle around to see how dominance has changed over
the years or click on a specific actor to isolate and monitor their activity
over time.</p>
