<h2 class="title">How to use the graphs?</h2>
<p>We recommend using the graphs on a large, hi-res screen.
Mobile devices and smaller screens will show less detail, diminishing the user experience.
</p>

<p>Select the working group or organisation you want to look at. By default,
youâ€™ll see information about the first working group in the list. Later, your browser will remember the WG and SDOs you selected last.</p>

<p> Hovering over any of the three visualisation allows you to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Zoom in, zoom out, and reset to the initial scale.</li>
    <li>Export plots by clicking on the camera icon. The export will always show the current view (i.e the currently visible selection and current zoom level). The exported file is a scalable vector image with a transparent background.</li>
    <li>You can also view individual actors within each plot by double clicking their name in the legend below / to the right of each plot.</li>
    <li>Further you can toggle other actors on and off by clicking on them.</li>
</ul>
