    <p>
    The IETF develops and promotes a wide range of internet protocols and
    standards, including the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP). For example, the
    IETF develops standards related to the Domain Name System (DNS), the
    directory of the internet which translates domain names to IP addresses.
    This allows browsers and other tools to connect to the right website or
    other internet resource. While IETF does not require formal membership and
    all participants are considered individual volunteers, a large number of
    participants are sent by their companies to participate in the development
    of particular standards. There are also costs associated with travelling to
    three in-person meetings every year – besides the US$875 registration fee.
    Draft documents and proposals at the IETF are known as Internet-Drafts
    (I-D). Once reviewed and published, they become a Request for Comment
    (RFC). RFCs can be classified as standard, informational, experimental, or
    historic.
