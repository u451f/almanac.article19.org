    <h1 class="title">World Wide Web Consortium |&nbsp;W3C</h1>
    <p>The W3C develops technical standards and guidelines for web technologies
    such as HTML and CSS. These standards influence the way people browse and
    use web services. The W3C is a membership organisation, where entities can
    participate by paying an annual membership fee ranging from US$1,000 to
    US$77,000, depending on the type of organisation, its revenue, and
    location. Individuals can also apply to be members using the same
    application process as organisations. While W3C membership is limited to
    organisations who pay a fee, participation in W3C groups varies. For many
    groups that are typically made up of dues-paying organisational members,
    individuals can be invited to participate without a fee.</p>
