    <h1 class="title">Internet Research Task Force |&nbsp;IRTF</h1>
    <p>The IRTF is a parallel organisation to the <a href="{{ site.url}}/orgs/3_ietf.html">IETF</a>.
    It promotes research on the evolution of
    the internet by creating focused, long-term research groups that study
    topics related to internet protocols, applications, architecture, and
    technology. The IRTF is open to all participants and meetings are
    co-located with the IETF. There are costs associated with travelling to the
    three in-person meetings every year, besides the US$875 registration fee
    that allows for participation in both the IETF and IRTF.
